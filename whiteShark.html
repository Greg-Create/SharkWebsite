  <p class="sharkDescription">The Great White Shark is one of the most iconic and feared species of shark in the world. Known for its massive size, powerful jaws, and razor-sharp teeth, the Great White is a formidable predator that can strike fear into the hearts of even the bravest swimmers.

    These sharks are found in cool and temperate waters around the world, and are known for their excellent swimming abilities. They are able to reach speeds of up to 35 mph, and can leap out of the water to catch their prey. Great White Sharks are carnivorous, feeding primarily on fish and marine mammals such as seals and sea lions.
    
    <br><br> While Great White Sharks are not recommended as pets for most aquarium owners, they can be studied and observed in the wild by scientists and marine biologists. These sharks are an important part of the ocean ecosystem, and play a vital role in maintaining the balance of marine life.
