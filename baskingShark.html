<p class="sharkDescription">The Basking Shark is a fascinating and gentle giant of the shark world. Despite its enormous size, this shark is a filter feeder, feeding primarily on plankton and other small organisms. Basking Sharks can grow up to 30 feet in length, making them one of the largest fish in the sea.

        These sharks are found in cool and temperate waters around the world, and are known for their distinctive appearance. Basking Sharks have a pointed snout and a large, gaping mouth that they use to filter feed. They are also known for their long, slender bodies and their powerful tails, which allow them to move quickly through the water.While Basking Sharks are not recommended as pets for most aquarium owners, they can be studied and observed in the wild by scientists and marine biologists.
