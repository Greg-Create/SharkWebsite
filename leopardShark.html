  <p class="sharkDescription">A species of houndshark belonging to the Triakidae family is the Leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata). From Oregon in the United States to Mazatl√°n in Mexico, it can be found along the Pacific coast of North America. This slender-bodied shark, which is typically 1.2-1.5 m (3.9-4.9 ft) long, is easily recognised by the remarkable pattern of black saddle-like markings and huge spots over its back, from which it derives its common name. In bays and estuaries, large schools of leopard sharks are frequently seen swimming over muddy or sandy flats or regions with plenty of rocks close to kelp beds and reefs. Along the coast, in waters that are less than 4 m (13 ft) deep, they are most prevalent.

Leopard sharks are active swimmers that frequently follow the tide into intertidal mudflats to hunt for food, which consists primarily of clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. The majority of leopard sharks prefer to stay there rather than make extensive migrations, which has caused genetic divergence amongst populations of sharks living in various locations.
