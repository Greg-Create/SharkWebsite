 <p class="sharkDescription">Angelsharks are a family of sharks that belong to the genus Squatina. They are most commonly found on sandy seabeds at depths of up to 150 metres (490 feet). The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified many species as critically endangered. Fishing pressure has resulted in significant population declines across large areas of the Northeast Atlantic, from Norway, Sweden, Morocco, and the Canary Islands to the Mediterranean and Black Seas.

        Squatinidae are distinguished by their flattened bodies and broad pectoral fins, which resemble rays. This genus is the sole member of the Squatiniformes family and order. They can be found in both temperate and tropical seas around the world. The majority of species live in shallow temperate or tropical seas, but a few live in deeper water, down to 1,300 m. (4,300 ft). Monkfish is another name for angel sharks, but it also refers to members of the genus Lophius.

     While some species have a large geographic range, the vast majority are restricted to a smaller area. The geographic range restriction could be due to the behaviour of Squatina species, which are ambush predators with a stationary bottom-dwelling habit. Even though large-scale coastal migratory patterns have been observed in species such as Squatina squatina, trans-ocean migration is extremely unlikely.</p>
