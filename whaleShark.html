    <p class="sharkDescription">The largest known extant fish species is the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), a slow-moving carpet shark that feeds on filters. The longest confirmed individual measured 18.8 metres in length (61.7 ft). The whale shark is the largest living non-mammalian vertebrate, and it holds several other records for size in the animal kingdom. It is the only living representative of the genus Rhincodon and the family Rhincodontidae, which is a member of the subclass Elasmobranchii of the class Chondrichthyes. It was categorised as a Rhinodontidae member before 1984. The whale shark inhabits the open oceans of the tropics and is infrequently encountered in water that is colder than 21 °C (70 °F). <br><br> The whale shark is one of three large filter-feeding sharks; the others are the megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios) and the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The whale shark forages for food at or near the surface of the ocean. Its large mouth is well adapted to filter feeding and contains more than 300 rows of small, pointed teeth in each jaw. Ichthyologists consider these teeth to be vestigial structures, and they do not play a role in feeding. As the shark swims with its mouth open, seawater enters the mouth cavity and filters through the gill slits.
