 <p class="sharkDescription">The Nurse Shark is a docile and fascinating species of shark that is found in warm waters throughout the world. These sharks are named for their tendency to lie on the ocean floor during the day, resembling a nursemaid watching over a child.

    Nurse Sharks have a distinctive appearance, with a broad, rounded head and a pair of small eyes set far apart. They are nocturnal hunters, feeding primarily on small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. Nurse Sharks are also known for their long lifespan, with some individuals living up to 25 years in the wild.
    
    While Nurse Sharks are not recommended as pets for most aquarium owners, they can be kept in large, properly maintained tanks by experienced enthusiasts. These sharks require a large amount of swimming space, as well as a varied diet and careful monitoring to ensure their health and well-being.
