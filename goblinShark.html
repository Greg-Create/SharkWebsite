<p class="sharkDescription">The Goblin Shark is a rare and mysterious species of shark that is known for its distinctive appearance and unusual feeding habits. These sharks are found in deep waters around the world, and are rarely encountered by humans due to their habitat.

    Goblin Sharks have a long, pointed snout and a protruding jaw that they use to catch their prey. They feed primarily on deep-sea creatures such as squid and fish, and are able to extend their jaw to catch prey that is out of reach.
    
    <br><br> While Goblin Sharks are not recommended as pets for most aquarium owners, they can be studied and observed in the wild by scientists and marine biologists. These sharks are an important part of the deep-sea ecosystem, and play a vital role in maintaining the balance of marine life.
