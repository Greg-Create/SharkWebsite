 <p class="sharkDescription">Requiem sharks are members of the Carcharhinidae family and the Carcharhiniformes order. Tiger sharks, bull sharks, lemon sharks, spinner sharks, blacknose sharks, blacktip sharks, grey reef sharks, blacktip reef sharks, silky sharks, dusky sharks, blue sharks, copper sharks, oceanic whitetip sharks, and whitetip reef sharks are all migratory, live-bearing sharks of warm seas. Carcharhiniform characteristics are shared by family members. Their eyes are round, and one or two gill slits run across the base of their pectoral fins. The majority of species are viviparous, with the young born fully developed. They range in size from 69 cm adult length for the Australian sharpnose shark to 5.5 m adult length for the tiger shark.

   While most aquarium owners do not recommend Requiem Sharks as pets, experienced enthusiasts can keep them in large, properly maintained tanks. To ensure their health and well-being, these sharks require a large amount of swimming space, as well as a varied diet and careful monitoring.

We have a variety of Requiem Sharks for sale on our website, including juvenile and adult specimens. To ensure that all of our sharks are ethically sourced and healthy, we work closely with certified breeders and importers. If you're looking for a one-of-a-kind and fascinating addition to your aquarium, a Requiem Shark could be the perfect fit!</p>
